# Recipe-API

This program was created as part of the Code First Girls MOOcs.
This was an 8 week course at the end of which, I created this program with 2 girls.

This program takes data from a recipe API, requests contraints from the user and then ouputs relevant recipes.

It took a collaborative effort from everyone to create a working code within the specified deadline. 

One of the challenges was to order the recipes based on weight. I first figured out which label within the API specified the weight, then I put the recipes and corresponding weight in a dictionary. I researched how to order dictionaries based on the value and used the lamba function to carry out the task.
